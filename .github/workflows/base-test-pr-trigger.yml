# Inspired by https://github.com/osbuild/bootc-image-builder/blob/031df2b115743a87b6684d4894f3d1730afefc98/.github/workflows/testingfarm.yml
name: Testing farm PR triggered tests

on:
  pull_request_target:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

# To use testing farm we need the TF_API_KEY secret available inside the
# forked repo which requires the pull_request_target trigger. To protect
# the secrets we need to make sure only people with repo write access
# can trigger this workflow. This means that ouside contributors will
# get an initial failure when the workflow is run. But once someone from
# the team re-triggers it it will work.
#
# Note that "pull_requqest_target" events are always triggered even
# when the "Fork pull request workflows from outside collaborators"
# setting is restricted to "Require approval for all outside collaborators"
# (see https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/approving-workflow-runs-from-public-forks)
#
# Note also that this precautions might be overkill because a fork
# cannot modify this workflow and all we do is run a branch inside
# testing farm. But a) the scope of workflow may expand over time
# b) it feels safer this way and is not a big burden in practise.
